# Project Structure
The project consists of a modules directory where classes and functionalites are defined. The contents of this directory are ment to be very general and reusable for similar purposes. Additionally there is a scripts and a tests directory. These directories can be used to write concrete scripts that run physically meaningful simulations to solve special problems and conduct tests to verify the functionality of the content of the modules directory. The contents of these directories are not ment to have dependencies among each other and self defined modules should only be imported from the modules directory.
